## I am...

I'm a passionate developer with more than 15 years experience in backend and frontend technologies.
I'm product minded and have pretty good analytical skills. Over the years I acquired some
acquaintance with best practices, testing, q&a, architecture,... got even obsessed with them.
With time I really like to adapt and create balance, I know more and more the conditions for
a successful project and I prefer to figure out and adapt to the given reality. I also do mentoring for
juniors, write open-source experiments on spare time and really like to help as project advisor.

## My current tech skills...

In this rapidly changing world, let's simply say that I'm working mainly with React / Typescript and its
associated ecosystem (redux, jest, webpack, babel...) for the **frontend**.
I first developed components to be embedded in traditional websites around 3 years ago,
then going the SPA (react-router, PWA's...) road. Nowadays I feel quite comfortable with it
and I must say I love it. The React/typescript combination is amazing.

On the **backend** side, I worked mainly with PHP even if I'm playing a lot with Node/Express which is quite
fun to do. I've been through the major frameworks like Zend or Symfony, concepts like MVC, DI, IoC, ORM... have
been integrated long time ago. I got really interested by application architecture (SOLID, DDD...), it definitely
brings effective solutions when the app grows. But sincerely more I learn, less I feel knowing.
At least I got few things on the way ;)
Nowadays and following the API centric trend, I mostly develop with micro-frameworks, like zend-expressive and
PSR specs. PHP in 2019 still rock solid !

I'm also expert in SQL and relational **databases** *(complex queries, optimizations, triggers, procedures, architecture...)*,
at least something that haven't changed much along the years.

I usually share my time between **architecture**, **frontend** and **backend**.

## What I'm looking for ?...

Ideally a front-end developer role within a human-sized team in Brussels area.
React & Typescript would be the perfect match, but I'm still open to mix it
with backend work (node, php). I'm also to open to short term missions (1m+). It all depends on the task.

## Good to know

I love design and UX but I'm so slow at it. I've
learned how to use CSS3, flexbox, grid,...
but really, I'm not a graphic designer *(although I ~~designed~~ committed this CV by myself)*.

I did have a long experience setting up infrastructure before the rise of k8s and friends.
I simply could not follow, still I have pretty good skills with linux infra, scripting, compilation...

Missed the train of NoSQL database. Feared consistencies problems, but Mongo is on my personal roadmap as
well as GraphQL.

Oops did I mention ? I love dance, yoga, art, photography, filming and I'm very sensitive to environmental questions
and challenges.
